            <h1><span class="emphasis">Hey There!</span><p>Welcome!</p></h1>
                <p>I'm a strategic thinker with a solid background in digital marketing and communications. I get a kick out of diving into creative projects and enhancing user experiences through genuine communication. My track record? Successfully spearheading projects across social, web, video, and radio.</p>
                <p>I'm all about making sure projects hit the mark on scope, time, and budget, along with key performance indicators. Thanks to my top-notch communication and project management skills, I'm a pro at building and maintaining strong relationships with stakeholders. Oh, and by the way, I'm neurodivergent â€“ dealing with the unique flavor of ADHD since '99! </p>

            <p>We recognise the Traditional Owners of Country throughout Australia, their diversity, histories and knowledge plus their continuing connection to lands, waters, sky and community. While we're located on unceeded Whadjuk Noongar land, we pay our respects to all Australian Indigenous peoples and their cultures; to their Elders past and present</p>
            <p>We pay our respects to those amongst the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex communities who have worked to support the improved health and wellbeing of their peers, children, families, friends and country.</p>

            <p>Our definition of women includes all women. Likewise, our definition of men includes all men: cisgender, transgender or gender divers. We also acknowledge and include those who identify beyond the binary. We honour the Elders in the diverse communities of which we are a part of and we celebrate the extraordinary diversity of people's bodies, genders, sexualities and relationships they represent.</p>
